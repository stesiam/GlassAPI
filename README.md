# Glass API

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/stesiam/GlassIdentificationAPI/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stesiam/GlassIdentificationAPI/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml)

This repo develops a [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) API  (an analogous tool to FastAPI of Python for API Development) that classifies glass based on its type (window / non-window), using ML model (Random Forest).
My model is built using [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and [ranger](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger) packages. The model build is **outside** the scope of docker. After the construction of my model, I exported it in an .RDS format which is used by API.

You can get the image by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker pull stesiam/glass-api
```
